					<h5 class="mt-4">Password and Encryption</h5>

					<p>User login passwords are salted, hashed and one-way
						encrypted using a strong algorithm. There is no way to decrypt
						those passwords. In-case of lost or forgotten passwords, resetting
						passwords is the only option to recover access to user account.</p>

					<p>No passwords are stored for user accounts that use Google
						SSO to login into Fusionmint. Responsibility of securing
						credentials for those accounts lies solely with Google.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4">User Data Access</h5>

					<p>All data communication between user browsers and servers is
						encrypted using latest SSL encryption standards. There is no other
						unsecure way to communicate with servers.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4">Business Data Security</h5>

					<p>As a business owner (and administrator) you are responsible
						for securing access to your data. We provide security and access
						control mechanisms for you to restrict data access to users with
						different access profiles. All data access is explicit so unless a
						user is given access specifically by the administrator, they have
						no data visibility or any other capability to do any action on
						your data.</p>

					<p>We as a service provider, do not have access to your data.
						In case you need our support in troubleshooting or help in
						configuring your system, you need to explicitly give our support
						team access to your data. After support is complete, access for
						our support team should be removed by you.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4">Data Centre Security and Access</h5>

					<p>
						We use <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>
						as our main cloud infrastructure provider, one of the leading name
						in cloud computing services. They have a highly secured
						infrastructure and multi-level security mechanisms in place to
						secure servers that house your data. Further details on their
						security are available here <a
							href="https://www.digitalocean.com/security" target="_blank">https://www.digitalocean.com/security</a>
					</p>

					<p>
						For our file storage services, we use <a
							href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web
							Services</a> (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), another leading name
						in cloud computing services. For more details about their
						security, please read <a
							href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/aws-security-whitepaper.pdf"
							target="_blank">AWS Security Whitepaper</a>
					</p>

					<p>Access to DigitalOcean and Amazon Web Services cloud
						infrastructure is limited to only certain employees in our
						organization. They are required to follow highest level of
						security measures and under go regular auditing to ensure that
						they follow industry standard security practices.</p>

					<p>Our servers are secured at multiple levels and data
						communication is regulated and allowed only the bare minimum
						access to ensure that services can run without any disruption.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4">Payments</h5>

					<p>
						We do not store any Credit Card information necessary to process
						billings and payments for your account. We use 2Checkout for all
						billings and they are PCI Level 1 certified. You can find more
						details on their security measure here <a
							href="https://www.2checkout.com/fraud-protection" target="_blank">https://www.2checkout.com/fraud-protection</a>

						Fusionmint users, then please report that immediately to our
						security team at: <a href="mailto: support@fusionmint.com">support@fusionmint.com</a>

						disclose the security vulnerability publicly, unless it has been
						resolved by us and communicated to all our affected customers for
						preventive action. Handling of data security is our topmost
						priority and your support in this regard is important for us.</p>

					<h5 class="mt-4">Data Breach Notification</h5>

					<p>We monitor our systems 24x7 for any suspicious activities or
						attacks. In the event of a suspected data breach, either noticed
						by us or communicated to us by any third-party, our first priority
						is to convene a fact-finding investigation team to determine
						whether a data breach or compromise has occurred and on
						confirmation take preventive measures to stop unauthorized access
						immediately by securing our systems.</p>

					<p>Responsibilities of the investigation team includes
						assessment of the extent and impact of the breach, preserve all
						evidence related to the breach for future analysis and also
						document all steps related to the breach investigation.</p>

					<p>Based on the nature of the breach, affected customers are
						notified within 30 days upon discovery of a data breach.
						Notification communication would include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Description of the incident in general terms and a
							timeline of the data breach.</li>
						<li>Description of the type of personal information that was
							subject to possible unauthorized access and acquisition.</li>
						<li>Details on actions taken by our team to protect the
							personal information from further unauthorized access.</li>
