						several months.</p>

						limitation if you breach the Terms. Upon termination of your
						account, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. If
						you wish to terminate your Fusionmint account, you may simply

						termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions,
						warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. It

						material change will be determined at Fusionmintâ€™s sole
						discretion. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming
						familiar with any such modifications. Using any service or viewing
						any content following notification of a material change to the
						terms shall constitute your acceptance of the Terms as modified.</p>
